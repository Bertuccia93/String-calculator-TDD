# STRING-CALCULATOR-TDD

This repository contains a program that [brief description].

## How to Compile and Test

Follow these steps to compile and test the program locally:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/repository.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd project-directory
    ```

3. To test the program with a minimal graphical interface, open the `index.html` file in your preferred browser.

   If you are using Visual Studio Code, you can streamline this process by installing the "Open in Browser" extension. After opening the `index.html` file, right-click and choose "Open in Default Browser."

4. Alternatively, if you have Node.js installed, you can run the following command to execute tests using Jest:

    ```bash
    npm test
    ```

    Modify the `script.test.js` file to change inputs and expected results for testing.
   
## N.B

I've included the 'node_modules' and dependencies to avoid having to run 'npm install' every time the project is cloned. I want to make sure that after cloning the repository, running 'npm start' immediately provides access to Jest.

I know is not a best practise and usaly i dont do this.

## Dependencies

Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (for running tests with Jest)
